			<br> @_yect, @_azetsirt.</p>
		<p style="font-size:160%;">Rodrigo Velasco is a graphic designer, visual artist and live coder based in Montréal, CA. His work explores the interrelations between sound
			<br> and image by creative audiovisual experiences in the context of live coding. As ‘yect’ he is live codes audiovisual sets across the world as part
			<br> of the Algorave scene. His current research investigates the 'Poetics of Live Coding.’ As part of this he organises occasional meetings
			<br> through 'onfcopoe', an open group that seeks to exploit sensitive and uncertain ways that reflect, express or cross the poetics of live coding.

		<p style="font-size:160%;"> I presented 'algotriste' in Hamilton, as part of the last International Conference on Live Coding 2016,
			<br> algotriste is a live coding audiovisual performance looking forward to create through sad noises,
			<br> slow, broken and nostalgic Algorave overtones, a continuous <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BLoKZ66jYMQ/" target="_blank">vibrant, but dead</a> feeling over the dancefloor.

			<p style="font-size:180%;">15/10/16 yect - live coding visuals to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/micorex" target="_blank"> Mico Rex</a> @ Algorave ICLC 2016</p>
			<p style="font-size:160%;"> I shared with the marvelous Mico Rex in the Hammer, so we rode bikes, laugh, drink, eat, sleep, and live code together for 5 days,
				<br> the last day, the last performance and one of the most amazing I have witnessed was Mico Rex destroying their cardboard boxes on stage.

				<br> but also had the opportunity to share a talk - demo of <a href="http://toplap.org/s2hs2/" target="_blank"> 's2hs2'</a> that was about an interface between <a href="https://processing.org/download/" target="_blank">Processing</a> and <a href="http://tidalcycles.org/"
				target="_blank">TidalCycles</a> to live code
				<br> the behaiviour of previously created visual stuff, I talked about the main paths in my experience (alien alphabets, visual poems, live code visuals
				<br> and graphic design) also, I invited all the people involved in the workshop to live code through 's2hs2', also you are invited!, click <a href="https://github.com/yecto/s2hs2-TidalCycles-0.8-/blob/master/README_English.md" target="_blank">here.</a>

				<br> while I talked about the prehistory of 's2hs2' and the possible futures of it, also I live coded some visual patterns, playing
				<br> and explaining how s2hs2 is actually working. The focus of the paper is to highlight the origin of the interface, which is strongly
				<br> linked with poetic doing, and also look at some approaches and/or departures from, I'm exploring and invite those interested to live code it.
